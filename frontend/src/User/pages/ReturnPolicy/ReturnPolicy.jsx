        Return policy
    </h3><br> <p className=''>
    Our return policy for farm products is managed by individual farmers. Each farmer has their own specific return, exchange, and refund policy, which is detailed on the product page. If you need to return or exchange a farm product, please contact the farmer directly using the information provided on the product page. Include your order number and reason for the return, and provide photos if the item is spoiled or incorrect.
    </p></br>
   <br><p>
   The return policy is divided into three parts; Do read all sections carefully to understand the conditions and cases under which returns will be accepted.

        Cancellation policy
    </h3>
    <br><p className=''>
    The buyer can choose to cancel an order any time before it's dispatched. The order cannot be canceled once it's out for delivery. However, the customer may choose to reject once it reaches at the buyer's destination.
        </p></br>
        <br><p className=''>
        The time window for cancellation varies based on different categories of products and the order cannot be canceled once the specified time has passed.
            </p></br>
            <br><p className=''>
            In some cases, the buyer may not be allowed to cancel the order for free, post the specified time and a cancellation fee will be charged.
                </p></br>
                <br><p className=''>
                Farmconnect reserves the right to accept the cancellation of any order. Farmconnect also reserves the right to waive off or modify the time window or cancellation fee from time to time.
